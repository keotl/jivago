The HTTP Resource Class
=========================
Jivago uses *Resource* classes to define HTTP routes. Routable classes should be annotated with the ``@Resource`` decorator with an URL path on which it should be mounted. Each routing *method* should then be annotated with one of the HTTP verbs (``@GET``, ``@POST``, etc.) to make them known to the framework, and can optionally define a subpath using the ``@Path`` annotation. 

.. literalinclude:: ../quickstart/complex_resource.py
   :language: python

Allowed Parameter Types
-------------------------
When handling a specific request, Jivago reads declared parameter types before invoking the routing function. Passed arguments can come from the query itself, from the body, from the raw request or a combination. Below are all the allowed parameter types :

* *QueryParam[T]* : Reads the parameter *matching the variable name* from the query string. *T* should be either ``str``, ``int`` or ``float``.
* *OptionalQueryParam[T]* : Identical to the above, except that it allows ``None`` values to be passed in place of a missing one.
* *PathParam[T]* : Reads the parameter from the url path. The variable name should match the declared name in the ``@Path`` or the ``@Resource`` annotation. Route definitions use the ``{path-parameter-name}`` to declare these parameters.
* *dict* : The request body which has been deserialized to a dictionary. Requires the body to be deserializable to a dictionary. (e.g. JSON).
* A user-defined DTO : Any declared ``@Serializable`` class will be instantiated before invoking. This effectively acts as a JSON-schema validation.
* *Request* : The raw ``Request`` object, as handled by Jivago. Useful when direct access to headers, query strings or the body is required.
* *Headers* : The raw ``Headers`` object, containing all request headers. This class is simply a case-insensitive dictionary.
  

Manual Route Registration
---------------------------

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2


Additionnal URL routes can be registered by creating a new ``RoutingTable`` which references classes and their methods. Note that the appropriate classes should be imported beforehand. The referenced resource class can be either an instance, or the actual class. In that case, it will be instantiated by the ServiceLocator, and should therefore be registered manually in the ``configure_service_locator`` context method.

.. literalinclude:: routing_table.py
   :language: python

This new ``RoutingTable`` can then be used to configure the ``Router`` object, which is used to serve all requests. The recommended way of configuring your application is by inheriting from the ``ProductionJivagoContext`` class, and then overriding the ``create_router_config`` method.

.. literalinclude:: router_config.py
   :language: python

Serving static files
--------------------
While it is not generally recommended to serve static files from a WSGI application for performance reasons, Jivago supports static file serving. The ``StaticFileRoutingTable`` dynamically defines routes for serving files.

.. literalinclude:: static.py
   :language: python

The ``StaticFileRoutingTable`` can also be used with a ``allowed_extensions`` parameter to explicitly allow or disallow specific file types.

HTTP Streaming responses
---------------------------
In cases where a streaming response is desired, Jivago provides the ``StreamingResponseBody`` object. Returning an instance of ``StreamingResponseBody`` will cause the ``Transfer-Encoding`` header to be automatically set to ``chunked``. A ``StreamingResponseBody`` object requires an ``Iterable[bytes]`` object.

.. literalinclude:: streaming_response.py
   :language: python

Note that chunked (streaming) requests and responses may not be supported by every wsgi server. Jivago has been tested with ``gunicorn``.


HTTP Streaming requests
---------------------------
Similarly, requests using ``Transfer-Encoding: chunked`` will be mapped automatically to a ``StreamingRequestBody`` instance.

.. literalinclude:: streaming_request.py
:language: python

Additional router configuration options, including specific filter and CORS rules, can be found at `Router Configuration`_.
